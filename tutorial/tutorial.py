# probfit Basic Tutorial

# <markdowncell>

# ##Lets start with a simple simple straight line
# 
# We can't really call this a fitting package without being able to fit a straight line, right?

# <codecell>

from probfit import describe, Chi2Regression
import iminuit
import numpy as np
import numpy.random as npr

# <codecell>

#lets make s straight line with gaussian(mu=0,sigma=1) noise
npr.seed(0)
x = linspace(0,10,20) 
y = 3*x+15+ randn(20)
err = np.array([1]*20)
errorbar(x,y,err,fmt='.');

# <codecell>

#lets define our line
#first argument has to be independent variable
#arguments after that are shape parameters
def line(x,m,c): #define it to be parabolic or whatever you like
    return m*x+c
#We can make it faster but for this example this is plentily fast.
#We will talk about speeding things up later(you will need cython)

# <codecell>

describe(line)

# <codecell>

#cost function
chi2 = Chi2Regression(line,x,y,err)

# <codecell>

#Chi^2 regression is just a callable object nothing special about it
describe(chi2)

# <codecell>

#minimize it
#yes it gives you a heads up that you didn't give it initial value
#we can ignore it for now
minimizer = iminuit.Minuit(chi2) #see iminuit tutorial on how to give initial value/range/error
minimizer.migrad(); #very stable robust minimizer
#you can look at your terminal to see what it is doing;

# <codecell>

#lets see our results
print minimizer.values
print minimizer.errors

# <codecell>

#or a pretty printing
minimizer.print_fmin()

# <markdowncell>

# ####Parabolic error
# is calculated using the second derivative at the minimum
# This is good in most cases where the uncertainty is symmetric not much correlation
# exists. Migrad usually got this accurately but if you want ot be sure
# call minimizer.hesse() after migrad
# ####Minos Error
# is obtained by scanning chi^2 and likelihood profile and find the the point
# where chi^2 is increased by 1 or -ln likelihood is increased by 0.5
# This error is generally asymmetric and is correct in all case.
# This is quite computationally expensive if you have many parameter.
# call minimizer.minos('variablename') after migrad to get this error

# <codecell>

#let's visualize our line
chi2.draw(minimizer)
#looks good

# <codecell>

#Sometime we want the error matrix
print 'error matrix:\n', minimizer.matrix()
#or correlation matrix
print 'correlation matrix:\n', minimizer.matrix(correlation=True)
#or a pretty html
#despite the method named error_matrix it's actually a correlation matrix
minimizer.print_matrix()

# <markdowncell>

# ##Simple gaussian distribution fit
# In high energy physics, we usually want to fit a distribution to a histogram. Let's look at simple gaussian distribution

# <codecell>

import numpy.random as npr
import iminuit
from probfit import BinnedLH

# <codecell>

#First lets make our data
npr.seed(0)
data = randn(10000)*4+1
#sigma = 4 and mean = 1
hist(data,bins=100,histtype='step');

# <markdowncell>

# Here is our PDF/model

# <codecell>

#normalized gaussian
def myPDF(x,mu,sigma):
    return 1/sqrt(2*pi)/sigma*exp(-(x-mu)**2/2./sigma**2)

# <codecell>

#build your cost function here we use binned likelihood
cost = BinnedLH(myPDF,data)

# <codecell>

#Let's fit
minimizer = iminuit.Minuit(cost,sigma=3.) #notice here that we give initial value to sigma
#but most of the time we want to see it before fitting
cost.draw(minimizer)

# <codecell>

minimizer.migrad() #very stable minimization algorithm
#like in all binned fit with long zero tail. It will have to do something about the zero bin
#dist_fit handle them gracefully but will give you a head up

# <codecell>

#you can see if your fit make any sense too
cost.draw(minimizer)#uncertainty is given by symetric poisson

# <codecell>

#let's see the result
print 'Value:', minimizer.values
print 'Error:', minimizer.errors

# <codecell>

#That printout can get out of hand quickly
minimizer.print_fmin()
#and correlation matrix
#will not display well in firefox(tell them to fix writing-mode:)
minimizer.print_matrix()

# <codecell>

#how about making sure the error making sense
minimizer.draw_mnprofile('mu');

# <codecell>

#2d contour error
#you can notice that it takes sometime to draw
#we will this is because our PDF is defined in Python
#we will show how to speed this up later
minimizer.draw_mncontour('mu','sigma');

# <markdowncell>

# ##How about Chi^2
# 
# Let's explore another popular cost function chi^2. Chi^2 is bad when you have bin with 0. ROOT just ignore. ROOFIT does something I don't remember. But's it's best to avoid using chi^2 when you have bin with 0 count.

# <codecell>

import numpy.random as npr
from math import sqrt,exp,pi
import iminuit
from probfit import Extended, gaussian, BinnedChi2, describe

# <codecell>

#we will use the same data as in the previous example
npr.seed(0)
data = npr.randn(10000)*4+1
#sigma = 4 and mean = 1
hist(data, bins=100, histtype='step');

# <codecell>

#And the same PDF: normalized gaussian
def myPDF(x,mu,sigma):
    return 1/sqrt(2*pi)/sigma*exp(-(x-mu)**2/2./sigma**2)

# <codecell>

#binned chi^2 fit only makes sense(for now) for extended fit
extended_pdf = Extended(myPDF)

# <codecell>

#very useful method to look at function signature
describe(extended_pdf) #you can look at what your pdf means

# <codecell>

#Chi^2 distribution fit is really bad for distribution with long tail
#since when bin count=0... poisson error=0 and blows up chi^2
#so give it some range
chi2 = BinnedChi2(extended_pdf,data,bound=(-7,10))
minimizer = iminuit.Minuit(chi2,sigma=1)
minimizer.migrad()

# <codecell>

chi2.draw(minimizer)

# <codecell>

#and usual deal
minimizer.print_fmin()
minimizer.print_matrix() 

# <markdowncell>

# ##Unbinned Likelihood and How to speed things up
# 
# Unbinned likelihood is computationally very very expensive.
# It's now a good time that we talk about how to speed things up with cython

# <codecell>

import numpy.random as npr
from probfit import UnbinnedLH, gaussian, describe
import iminuit

# <codecell>

#same data
npr.seed(0)
data = npr.randn(10000)*4+1
#sigma = 4 and mean = 1
hist(data,bins=100,histtype='step');

# <codecell>

#We want to speed things up with cython
#load cythonmagic
%load_ext cythonmagic

%%cython
cimport cython
from libc.math cimport exp,M_PI,sqrt
#same gaussian distribution but now written in cython
@cython.binding(True)#IMPORTANT:this tells cython to dump function signature too
def cython_PDF(double x,double mu,double sigma):
    #these are c add multiply etc not python so it's fast
    return 1/sqrt(2*M_PI)/sigma*exp(-(x-mu)**2/2./sigma**2)

# <codecell>

#cost function 
ublh = UnbinnedLH(cython_PDF,data)
minimizer = iminuit.Minuit(ublh,sigma=2.)

ublh.show(minimizer)

minimizer.print_matrix() 

# <codecell>

#remember how slow it was?
#now it's super fast(and it's even unbinned likelihood)
minimizer.draw_mnprofile('mu');

# <markdowncell>

# But you really don't have to write your own gaussian there are tons of builtin function written in cython for you.

# <codecell>

ublh.draw(minimizer, show_errbars='normal') # control how fit is displayed too

# <markdowncell>

# ##But... We can't normalize everything analytically and how to generate toy sample from PDF
# 
# When fitting distribution to a PDF. One of the common problem that we run into is normalization.
# Not all function is analytically integrable on the range of our interest.
# Let's look at crystal ball function.

# <codecell>

from probfit import crystalball, gen_toy, Normalized, describe, UnbinnedLH
import numpy.random as npr
import iminuit

# <codecell>

#lets first generate a crystal ball sample
#dist_fit has builtin toy generation capability
#lets introduce crystal ball function
#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Ball_function
#it's simply gaussian with power law tail
#normally found in energy deposited in crystals
#impossible to normalize analytically
#and normalization will depend on shape parameters
describe(crystalball)

# <codecell>

npr.seed(0)
bound = (-1,2)
data = gen_toy(crystalball,10000,bound=bound,alpha=1.,n=2.,mean=1.,sigma=0.3,quiet=False)
#quiet = False tells it to plot out original function
#toy histogram and poisson error from both orignal distribution and toy

# <codecell>

#To fit this we need to tell normalized our crystal ball PDF
#this is done with trapezoid rule with simple cache mechanism
#can be done by Normalized functor
ncball = Normalized(crystalball,bound)
#this can also bedone with declerator
#@normalized_function(bound)
#def myPDF(x,blah):
#    return blah
print 'unnorm:', crystalball(1.0,1,2,1,0.3)
print '  norm:', ncball(1.0,1,2,1,0.3)

# <codecell>

#it has the same signature as the crystalball
describe(ncball)

# <codecell>

#now we can fit as usual
ublh = UnbinnedLH(ncball,data)
minimizer = iminuit.Minuit(ublh,
    alpha=1.,n=2.1,mean=1.2,sigma=0.3)
minimizer.set_up(0.5)#remember this is likelihood
minimizer.migrad()#yes amazingly fast Normalize is written in cython
ublh.show(minimizer)
#crystalball function is nortorious for its sensitivity on n parameter
#dist_fit give you a heads up where it might have float overflow

# <markdowncell>

# ##But what if I know analytical integral formula
# probfit check for integrate method that can be called by integrate(bound, nint, *arg) to
# compute definite integral for given bound and nint(pieces of integral this is normally ignored)
# and the rest will be passed as positional argument. Couple of probfit already have analytical formula written.

# <codecell>

from probfit import integrate1d
def line(x, m, c):
    return m*x+c

#compute integral of line from x=(0,1) using 10 intevals with m=1. and c=2.
#all probfit internal use this
print integrate1d(line, (0,1), 10, (1.,2.) ) # no integrate method available probfit use simpson3/8

#Let us illustrate the point by forcing it to have integral that's off by
#factor of two
def wrong_line_integral(bound, nint, m, c):
    a, b = bound
    return 2*(m*(b**2/2.-a**2/2.)+c*(b-a)) # I know this is wrong 
line.integrate = wrong_line_integral
# line.integrate = lambda bound, nint, m, c: blah blah # this works too
print integrate1d(line, (0,1), 10, (1.,2.))

# <headingcell level=2>

# What if things went wrong

# <codecell>

#crystalball is nortoriously sensitive to initial parameter
#now it is a good time to show what happen when things...doesn't fit
ublh = UnbinnedLH(ncball,data)
minimizer = iminuit.Minuit(ublh)#NO initial value
minimizer.set_up(0.5)#remember this is likelihood

#Remember there is a heads up

# <codecell>

ublh.show(minimizer)#it bounds to fails

# <codecell>

minimizer.migrad_ok(), minimizer.matrix_accurate()
#checking these two method give you a good sign
