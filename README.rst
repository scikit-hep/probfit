probfit
-------

*probfit* is a set of functions that helps you construct a complex fit. It's
intended to be used with `iminuit <http://iminuit.github.io/iminuit/>`_. The
tool includes Binned/Unbinned Likelihood estimator, :math:`\chi^2` regression,
Binned :math:`\chi^2` estimator and Simultaneous fit estimator.
Various functors for manipulating PDF such as Normalization and
Convolution(with caching) and various builtin functions
normally used in B physics is also provided.

    import numpy as np
    from iminuit import Minuit
    from probfit import UnbinnedLH, gaussian
    data = np.random.randn(10000)
    unbinned_likelihood = UnbinnedLH(gaussian, data)
    fitter = Minuit(unbinned_likelihood, mean=0.1, sigma=1.1)
    fitter.migrad()
    unbinned_likelihood.draw(fitter)
